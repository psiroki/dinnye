# Dinnye

Dinnye is a fruit merge game designed to run efficiently on very weak hardware, such as devices using the F1C100s SoC. This performance is achieved through the use of fixed-point math, including a highly effective [fixed-point reciprocal square root approximation](docs/rsqrt.md).

In Hungarian, *Dinnye* means "watermelon"â€”a playful codename for the project. The game has since evolved, and now players merge planets rather than fruits.
